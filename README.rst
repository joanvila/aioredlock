The asyncio redlock_ algorithm implementation.

Redlock and asyncio
-------------------

The redlock algorithm is a distributed lock implementation for Redis_. There are many implementations of it in several languages. In this case, this is the asyncio_ compatible implementation for python 3.5+.


Usage
-----
.. code-block:: python

  from aioredlock import Aioredlock

  # Define a list of connections to your Redis instances:
  redis_instances = [
    {'host': 'localhost', 'port': 6379}
  ]

  # Create a lock manager:
  lock_manager = Aioredlock(redis_instances)

  # Try to acquire the lock:
  lock = await lock_manager.lock("resource_name")

  # extend lock lifetime
  await lock_manager.extend(lock)

  # Release the lock:
  await lock_manager.unlock(lock)

  # Clear the connections with Redis
  await lock_manager.destroy()


How it works
------------

The Aioredlock constructor takes a list of connections (host and port) where the Redis instances are running as a required parameter.
In order to acquire the lock, the ``lock`` function should be called. If the lock operation is successful, ``lock.valid`` will be true.

From that moment, the lock is valid until the ``unlock`` function is called or when the 10 seconds timeout is reached.

To extend lock lifetime for more 10 seconds call ``extend`` function.

In order to clear all the connections with Redis, the lock_manager ``destroy`` method can be called.

To-do
-----

* Allow the user to set a desired lock timeout with 10 seconds default
* Raise an exception if the lock cannot be obtained so no need to check for `lock.valid`
* Handle/encapsulate aioredis exceptions when performing operations
* Expire the lock valid attribute according to the lock validity in a safe way if possible
